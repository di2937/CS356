    "For the threaded server, I designed it so that threads could perform tasks as independently as possible so as to avoid loss of efficiency over synchronization. Each thread performed a small but monolothic task. One thread (the main thread) processed user input. Another performed all of the socket I/O and pushed raw bytes into a thread-safe queue as a nonblocking operation. Another thread processed the bytes from the queue into packets, performing correctness checks and taking the packets to the correct session for processing and handling responses plus errors. Timer threads would be scheduled once per each session every time a message was received. Lastly, there was a thread that popped logs (which were just tuples that would be splatted into print) pushed in by other threads and printed them to stdout. All of these functions except for timers operated within while loops, which checked a shared boolean variable that indicated whether or not the server was in a closing state. For all threads operating on queues, a sentinel value of `None` was pushed into their respective queues, with an if statement to check if such a value was emplaced into a queue. In total, this yield 4+ threads, though usually it's just 4 executing at the same time."

For threads that used queues, I inserted `None`, which they knew to interpret as an end of life value to receive from a queue. I then iterated through the sessions hash map and called the close method, which would clean up the timer objects. I then closed the socket using the shutdown method. Although UDP sockets are connectionless and can't actually 'shut down', for some reason the idiomatic close method doesn't wake up sleeping threads, so I have to surround the shutdown call with a try-except block.

This superclass provides a useful callback in the form of `datagram_received`, which handles the dirty work for receiving packets from a nonblocking socket (called a Transport in asyncio). Tasks are created for reading from standard input and timeouts and waited upon in the input loop. A task is also created for sending data, as while writes are nonblocking and don't have any result to yield for, as a client we are obligated to wait for a response from the server or time out if the server doesn't respond within ten seconds. We can spend this time processing subsequent user input, and if it turns out we've timed out by the time we've received user input, we can simply discard it. In a sense, it works similarly to branch prediction. In total, this yields three tasks/threads."

Additionally, the concept of coroutines is conducive to well structured, single threaded control flows. With this in mind, an asynchronous client using the same design philosophy I described when writing about how I designed my server to run efficiently would intrinsically be faster. I wasn't able to test messages close to the UDP max since readline() only handles up to 4096 bytes of input, but since the receive callback and sendto() operate in different tasks, they absolutely can handle writing and receiving packets to and from the server at the same time."
